As Streamlit cloud's oldest available version of Python is 3.9.22 and the code was built in PyCharm on Python 3.9.0
there are mismatches in compatible versions of libraries that prevent it from being deployed to Streamlit cloud. 
The raw files are available here on Github. 
To launch the streamlit app locally, when downloaded with the correct packages and versions, 
in the terminal, enter the command: streamlit run <file path>. On my system, this is:
streamlit run "C:\Users\Sam's Folder\Final_Project_App\main.py"
The quotations around the path is due to their being a space and apostrophe in my file path. it wouldnt be required for most paths. 
In the demo video of the software, this process is shown.
